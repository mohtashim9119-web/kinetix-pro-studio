## Current State

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Last updated | 2026-07-01 |
| Current HEAD | `be45b07` ("fix: eliminate preview/playhead jump on timeline resize-drag (D12)"). Root cause was a native ghost click on the timeline's left-edge resize handle firing `onSeek` directly on mouseup; fixed with a capture-phase click-swallower, alongside three secondary hardening fixes (seek-effect guard, transition-preview gate, frozen `currentSegment` during resize). Effects Tab Rebuild Step 8 — transitions renderer complete (10/10). Architecture Shift complete (2026-06-24). |
| App status | Shipping desktop app — Tauri DMG/installer, native ffmpeg sidecar export. No server, no web hosting. |
| Target users | YouTube creators — initial internal use across 5–10 channels |
| Repo | TBD |
| Restore tag | `sync-known-good-2026-06-20` → commit `bab79b0` ("chore: remove VO-DIAG/SYNC-DIAG debug logging") |

All foundational/export/desktop/sync work is shipped and stable, including the clean-slate re-sync Architecture Shift (closed 2026-06-24, commit `254ef1b`). Effects Tab Rebuild is complete (transitions 10/10, clip effects 7/7). Active work is feature tasks only — see Active Tasks.

## Completed Work

<details>
<summary>D12 fixed — preview/playhead jump on timeline resize-drag — ✅ DONE 2026-07-01 (commit be45b07)</summary>

Root cause was a native ghost click, not the derived-state race originally suspected. A resize-drag ends with the cursor away from the left-edge handle's DOM position (segment rows are flex items — a row's on-screen left edge is the sum of every preceding row's width, which never changes while that row is being resized, so the fixed `left-0` handle never tracks the cursor the way the `right-0` handle does). The browser's native `click`, synthesized immediately after `mouseup` and hit-tested at the release position, was landing on the segment row body instead of the handle — firing `onClick`'s `onSeek(s.startTime)` (`Timeline.tsx`) directly, moving the real playhead. Fixed with a one-time, capture-phase `window` `click` listener armed in `handleUp` only when the drag actually moved the mouse (`App.tsx`).

Three secondary issues surfaced and were fixed along the way, kept in the codebase as real (if now largely redundant) hardening: (1) `PreviewStage.tsx`'s dual-slot video seek effect now skips reseeking while `isResizingRef.current` is true, cleared deterministically by a `resizingId`-keyed effect (child-before-parent commit ordering) instead of a racy `requestAnimationFrame` clear; (2) `useTransitionPreview.ts` forces `inTransitionWindow`/`needsPreRoll`/`isActive` false during a drag, so the transition-preview canvas can't swap in a snapshot of the wrong segment's frame; (3) `App.tsx`'s `currentSegment` is frozen at the source during a drag (`lastStableSegmentRef` + one-shot `resizeSettleTick` recompute on release), since `PreviewStage` reads `currentSegment` directly in many ungated places beyond the seek effect (image src, captions, Ken Burns transform, cross-segment transition props). `tsc --noEmit` clean and 17/17 vitest passing throughout. Manually verified across left/right-edge drags, both directions, segments near and far from the playhead.

<details>
<summary>Caption rendering fidelity — ✅ DONE 2026-06-30 (commits 60aa676, ae6165a, and this commit)</summary>

Export caption now honors `fontWeight`/`fontStyle`/`textShadow` (D1, commit `60aa676`); preview caption scales font/padding/radius proportionally to stage height, mirroring `frameRenderer`'s `refScale` (commit `ae6165a`); caption max-width unified to 70% of render width in BOTH preview (CSS `maxWidth: '70%'`) and export (`frameRenderer` `w * 0.7`) for wrap parity. Preview and export now match. Manual export + preview tests passed.
</details>

<details>
<summary>D10 fixed — preview transition black flash on video boundaries — ✅ DONE 2026-06-30</summary>

D10 fixed — preview transition black flash on video→video boundaries eliminated. Root cause: the idle video slot was preloaded (bytes buffered) but never pre-seeked, so seek+first-paint was deferred to the swap moment; the prior canvas-hold attempt gated on 'canplay' (fires before paint). Fix (`PreviewStage.tsx`): warm the idle dual-video slot ahead of time (seek to `nextSeg.trimStart||0` during preload) and gate the reveal on an actual painted frame via `requestVideoFrameCallback`, with a 'seeked'+rAF fallback and 400ms failsafe; warmed common path reveals synchronously (no added latency); existing canvas-hold retained as fallback for unwarmed edge cases (short segments/scrubbing). Image/color paths untouched. Verified acceptable on macOS; Windows/WebView2 spot-check not separately performed (rVFC+fallbacks are engine-agnostic).
</details>

<details>
<summary>D6 fixed — kinetix:ui:v1 lost-update race closed — ✅ DONE 2026-06-30 (commit 3b0702f)</summary>

D6 fixed — kinetix:ui:v1 lost-update/structural race closed by consolidating the three read-modify-write writers (2 in App.tsx, 1 in Timeline.tsx) plus all 7 lazy-initializer reads into a single standalone module `src/services/uiStateStore.ts` (`readUiState`/`patchUiState`). Behavior unchanged (same fields, same write timing, same isPlaying gating, same 300ms scroll-restore); only the read-merge-write mechanics are now centralized and atomic per call. Manually verified: reload preserves panel/scroll/playhead/tab; dashboard project-switch resets to 0:00. Commit `3b0702f`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Architecture shift — ✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-24 (Step 7, commit 254ef1b)</summary>

- **Scene editor read-only:** NOT IMPLEMENTED — superseded. No `readOnly`/disabled gate on the Scene Details editor. Corruption was solved by clean-slate re-sync + confirm-dialog/auto-snapshot instead. Edits remain possible; just not preserved across re-sync.
- ✅ Done (Step 5) — Headings live array-only, never serialized to sceneDetails text.
- ✅ Done — `DropZonePanel.tsx`'s `isStagedEmpty` gate disables Apply Sync unless a file is newly staged.
- **Auto-recalc: PARTIAL.** `applyAnchorBasedTiming()` runs on lock toggle, heading insert/delete, and inside the sync pipeline. But timeline drag-resize uses `applyDurationChange`/`computeDragCascade` — a separate path.
- Direction changed to CLEAN-SLATE RE-SYNC — Apply Sync wipes all derived state and re-derives fresh from audio; nothing carried forward.

**Clean-slate steps (all done):** 3a (`452e1eb`) delete merge loops; 3b regression tests; 3c (`5da64df`/`8523f39`) delete anchor-aware aligner + skip-guard; 3d-1 (`eb7fc8e`) anchor fallback; 3d-2 (`f27d557`) delete PASS 2; 3e (`6090250`) dead anchorSource demotion; Step 5 5.1–5.4 headings array-only; Step 7 (`254ef1b`) final regression.

**Restore tags:** `sync-known-good-2026-06-20` → `bab79b0`; `sync-known-good-2026-06-23` → `a1a326d`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Bottom drawer + shared controls — ✅ DONE 2026-06-27 (commit 4887d33)</summary>

- ✅ **Shared `SegmentControls` extraction** — the controls portion of `ReviewMappingRow` (both scene-card and heading-card layouts, the field/button/swatch style consts, `updateHC`, and the `.rm-slider`/`.rm-swatch` `<style>` block) is now `src/components/SegmentControls.tsx`. `ReviewMappingModal` renders thumbnail + `<SegmentControls/>` (modal appearance/behavior unchanged — pure move); the bottom drawer renders `<SegmentControls/>` only (no thumbnail, full width). Non-audio asset filtering lives once, inside `SegmentControls`. The drawer's old `<textarea>` overlay input became the shared single-line input, and its phantom shadow control (export never applied it) was dropped.
- ✅ **Bottom drawer centered at 50vw, viewport-anchored** — wrapper switched from `absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0` to `fixed bottom-0` with `left: 50%`, `width: 50vw`; centering expressed through Framer Motion (`x: '-50%'` on all three keyframes) since motion owns the element transform. Drawer position is now independent of side-panel collapse state.
- ✅ **Mute toggle moved to drawer header** — sits to the left of the lock icon, scene-only (headings have no embedded audio); the old body mute row was removed so scene and heading drawers are the same height. *(The mute toggle itself — and the underlying `isMuted` field — was removed entirely on 2026-07-01 as dead code with no consumer; formerly tracked as D3.)*
- ✅ **Left-panel segment click syncs preview + timeline** — clicking a row now calls `handleSegmentClick` (App.tsx), which sets `selectedSegmentId` AND seeks the time-driven preview to the segment's `startTime` (mirrors the timeline onSeek pattern). `Timeline.tsx` gained an effect that auto-scrolls the active segment into view on `currentSegmentId` change (only when off-screen, so it never fights manual scrubbing).

<details>
<summary>Effects Tab Rebuild — Steps 5–7 + drawer pills — DONE 2026-06-27 (commits dd903b2, d0d8ca2, d750ce3, 4b13cb0)</summary>

- Step 5 — Apply to selected/all (`dd903b2`) — EffectsPanel's Apply buttons now write real segment effect fields (`effectTransition`/`effectTransitionDuration`, `effectAnimation`/`effectAnimationDuration`, `effectOverlay`) via `setProject(...map...)` in `App.tsx`'s `handleApplyEffect`, scoped to the multi-select Set ("selected") or every non-heading segment ("all"). Headings are always skipped.
- Step 6 — Randomize across segments (`d0d8ca2`) — per-segment random slug pulled from the checked pool, written the same way as Step 5; existing per-segment duration preserved; headings skipped.
- Step 7 — Combined-look presets (`4b13cb0`) — new dedicated service `src/services/lookPresetService.ts` (localStorage key `kinetix:lookPresets:v1`, global across projects, cap `MAX_LOOK_PRESETS = 20`). `EffectsPanel.tsx`'s preset UI (save/restore/delete, name input, "Restored {name}" panel) round-trips through `DropZonePanel.tsx`'s `handleLookPresetsChange`, which diffs the incoming list against the previously-known ids to add/remove only what changed, then re-reads the authoritative list back down as `initialPresets`. `App.tsx`'s preset branch in `handleApplyEffect` writes all five effect fields from the preset in one pass, respecting the same selected/all + heading-skip rules as Steps 5–6. Fixed same-session: the service originally re-minted a `crypto.randomUUID()` on every save, orphaning the id `EffectsPanel` had already generated and breaking the "Restored" active-row highlight right after saving — `saveLookPreset` now accepts and persists the caller-supplied id as-is (with a same-id guard against duplicate rows on a re-fired save). Legacy `presetService.ts` (single-category `StylePreset`, used for overlay-config font presets) is untouched — combined-look presets got their own store rather than bending that shape to fit three slugs + two durations.
- Bonus — drawer header effect-pills (`d750ce3`) — read-only pill row in the bottom drawer header surfaces the currently-applied transition/animation/overlay per segment (icon + label, centered grid, off-states hidden).
- `tsc --noEmit` clean and 17/17 vitest passing after each commit. All four commits are local on `main`, **not yet pushed** — `origin/main` is still at `1e249df`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Left-panel UI restructure — ✅ DONE 2026-06-30 (commits 0c577e9, f0ee59c, 65d5d66, 8fe8a78)</summary>

- Files tab redesign — compact headers, metadata rows, timestamps, Apply Sync gradient (`0c577e9`).
- Apply Sync stuck-in-syncing fix — clear pending voiceover on project switch and cache-hit re-stage (`f0ee59c`).
- Left panel redesign — heading rows, accent bar, Files tab polish, sync button fix (`65d5d66`).
- Segments tab header restructured into two rows: count/runtime + search input on row 1, the three unified action buttons (lock/unlock all, review, select-all/clear) stretched `flex-1` across row 2 (`8fe8a78`). Added `segmentSearch` state filtering the segment list by `seg.text`, preserving the original array index (`i`) through a `return null` guard inline in the existing `.map()` so `rowRefs`, `dropTargetIdx`, and `onMoveHeading` heading-drag logic stay correct while filtered.
- Recycle bin permanently dropped (no longer present in DropZonePanel.tsx).
- `tsc --noEmit` clean and 17/17 vitest passing.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Four UI bugs fixed — ✅ DONE 2026-06-30 (commits 66fdabf, e967a8d, ddfde06)</summary>

* ✅ Bug 1 — Cancel on new-project popup no longer creates a ghost project. Mount effect zero-projects branch now shows empty dashboard instead of auto-opening the modal.
* ✅ Bug 2 — Project name is inline editable from top-left panel (click to edit, blur/Enter saves, Escape discards). Top-right display is read-only and updates reactively.
* ✅ Bug 3 — UI state fully persists on reload: active tab, left/right panel collapse state, preview divider height, currentTime, selectedSegmentId, timeline horizontal scroll. handleSwitchProject gained a preserveUiState flag — reload preserves position, dashboard switch resets to 0:00.
* ✅ Bug 4 — Left panel segment list auto-scrolls to active segment during playback AND on manual timeline click while paused. Timeline horizontal scroll persists via debounced listener in Timeline.tsx, restored at 300ms after mount.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Effects Step 8 — transitions complete (10/10, commit 76ccf16)</summary>

All 10 transition slugs rendered in `frameRenderer.ts` (`applyTransitionBlend`)
and `useTransitionPreview.ts`/`PreviewStage.tsx`:
- Batch A: hard-cut, cross-dissolve, zoom, dip-black, dip-white, slide-push,
  whip-pan, wipe (commits 3779222, f928546, c0ab24f range)
- Batch B: glitch-rgb (lazy scratch-canvas compositing, screen blend, no
  getImageData), light-leak (radial gradient bloom, screen blend, peaks at
  alpha=0.5) — commit 76ccf16
- Caption fixes landed alongside: 6c88da0, 4a65379, f1676a9, a61bfe8
- First use of globalCompositeOperation='screen' in frameRenderer.ts
- Known issue logged: transition timing is 100/0 split, not true 50/50
  (see Ignored Low Risk Bugs D7)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Review Mapping modal — feature-complete — ✅ DONE 2026-06-27 (commit 23c8227)</summary>

The Review Mapping modal (task 7, shipped then delisted) reached feature-complete status. Final follow-up: live per-segment thumbnail renders the overlay/heading text layer (font, weight, italic, size, color, bg, bg-None, x/y) scaled proportionally to the thumbnail box, updating in real time as the row is edited. Positioning math mirrored locally in the modal — `PreviewStage`, `frameRenderer`, and `types.ts` untouched. Heading italic intentionally not rendered (unwired everywhere). Commit `23c8227`.

## Active Tasks

None currently.

## Deferred Polish Features

- Version snapshots (2 open design decisions before building: asset-restoration Design A vs B, and full-rewind-on-restore)
- Auto-captions (reuse Whisper transcript tokens as a timed text layer)
- Procedural overlays: 4 remaining — Letterbox, Vignette, CRT/Scanlines, Viewfinder (pure canvas draw ops, no legacy-twin interactions) *(renderer not yet wired)*
- Asset-backed overlays: 6 blocked — Film Grain, Light Leaks, Film Damage, Atmospheric Particles, Weather, Fire/Embers (waiting on user-supplied black-bg screen-blend footage; render via ctx.globalCompositeOperation='screen')
- Color-grade parametric: brightness/contrast/saturation sliders per segment (currently ships as fixed cinematic preset; parametric needs new VideoSegment fields + UI panel)
- Export speedup: OffscreenCanvas/Worker (profiling done — I/O-bound, convertToBlob off main thread projected 40–55% faster)

## Deferred Known Bugs

Real behavioral bugs — each needs design before a fix can be written.

- **D4 — Lock/heading ops revert drag edits:** toggling lock or inserting/deleting a heading calls `applyAnchorBasedTiming`, which re-derives all timings from stale `anchorStart` values, silently discarding prior manual drag-resizes. `App.tsx`, `syncEngine.ts`
- **D5 — Locked-segment duration grows but never shrinks:** `applyAnchorBasedTiming` uses `Math.max(preserved, span)` for locked segments, so a locked segment whose preserved duration exceeds its anchor span inflates the running total and threatens invariant (b). `syncEngine.ts`

## Effects Tab Rebuild — Plan (Active Task 1)

The Effects tab already exists and works (global-only) in DropZonePanel.tsx.
This is a guided rebuild to a new fixed UI (from mockup.tsx, design-locked) made
fully functional in steps. UI layout/structure stays exactly as designed; only
the accent is re-tokened to the app branding orange (#e07c3a), reconciling the
existing #F27D26 / #ee8b3f variants.

KEY DECISIONS (locked):
- "Apply to selected" = TRUE MULTI-SELECT of segments (selectedSegmentId becomes
  a Set).
- Per-segment effect fields MUST survive both reload AND Apply Sync — requires
  patching parseProjectData to preserve them (fixes clean-slate wipe of
  per-segment fields).
- Dropdowns/randomize-pools/presets all read ONE shared option source; no entry
  is ever wired to a renderer case that does nothing (no phantom enums).
- Accent canonical = #e07c3a.
- Presets = COMBINED LOOK: capture one option from each of the 3 dropdowns
  (transition + animation + overlay) + custom name; up to 20; selecting restores
  the 3 dropdown values, then exposes Apply to selected / Apply to all. Does NOT
  capture overlay style/color (likely a new combined-preset store rather than
  bending the legacy single-category presetService).

OVERLAY BACKGROUND HANDLING (important):
- Stock overlays ship with a black/white/green background; it is NOT removed
  automatically.
- Asset-backed overlays MUST be sourced as BLACK-BACKGROUND screen-blend footage.
- REQUIRED FUNCTION: the renderer must remove the black background by compositing
  the overlay with a "screen" blend mode — ctx.globalCompositeOperation='screen'
  in export (frameRenderer) and mix-blend-mode:screen in preview (PreviewStage).
  Pure black becomes transparent; bright areas show through. Each asset overlay
  carries a blend-mode setting (default 'screen'; 'multiply' available for
  white-background assets).
- Green-screen / chroma-key removal is EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE (per-pixel keying;
  dropped earlier). Do not source green-screen overlays.

EFFECT LISTS (final, feasibility-resolved):
Transitions (10, all buildable): Hard Cut, Cross Dissolve, Dip to Black,
  Dip to White, Wipe, Slide/Push, Glitch/RGB Split, Whip Pan, Zoom, Light Leak
  (Light Leak via procedural radial-gradient flash if no asset).
Clip Effects (10, all buildable): Color Correction/Grading, Zoom In, Zoom Out,
  Ken Burns, Speed Ramping (maps to playbackSpeed — interacts with sync auto-fit;
  handle carefully), Gaussian Blur, Pixelate/Mosaic, Duotone/Color Wash,
  Sepia/Vintage, Invert.
Overlays (10): PROCEDURAL-now (4): Letterbox, Vignette, CRT/Scanlines, Viewfinder.
  ASSET-BACKED-later (6, shown DISABLED until media uploaded; black-bg screen-blend
  only): Film Grain, Light Leaks, Film Damage, Atmospheric Particles,
  Weather (Rain/Fog/Snow), Fire/Embers.
Dropped as non-feasible in this engine: Match Cut, Morph Cut, Crop, Masking &
  Tracking, Warp Stabilizer, Chroma Key.

STEPS:
1. ✅ DONE (`3bbd926`) — Land UI — mount EffectsPanel (from mockup.tsx) in place
   of the inline Effects section in DropZonePanel.tsx; retoken accent to #e07c3a;
   all buttons no-op stubs; placeholder labels OK. tsc + vitest clean.
2. ✅ DONE (`3c0d3af`) — Real option arrays — replace placeholders with the final
   lists above as {label,value} from one shared source (`effectsOptions.ts`);
   asset-backed overlays marked disabled. No renderer work.
3. ✅ DONE (`330c79e`) — Multi-select model — convert selectedSegmentId (single)
   to a Set; wire multi-select in the segment list/timeline; feed count into
   panel "N selected".
4. ✅ DONE (`f2dd193`) — Per-segment persistence — patch parseProjectData to
   preserve effect fields (transition/animation/overlay/duration); verify
   round-trip through projectStore AND survival across Apply Sync.
5. ✅ DONE (`dd903b2`) — Apply to selected/all — replace stubs with real handlers
   writing to the selected Set or all segments via setProject(...map...).
6. ✅ DONE (`d0d8ca2`) — Randomize across segments — wire per-block randomize from
   checked pool across all segments; same persistence path.
7. ✅ DONE (`4b13cb0`) — Combined-look presets — new dedicated localStorage store
   (`src/services/lookPresetService.ts`, key `kinetix:lookPresets:v1`, cap 20):
   save = 3 dropdown values + name; select = restore dropdowns; apply reuses
   step-5 handlers. Legacy `presetService.ts` left untouched/unrelated — combined
   look got its own store rather than bending the single-category service.
   Bonus (same arc, commit `d750ce3`): read-only effect pills in the bottom
   drawer header surface the applied transition/animation/overlay per segment.
8. ✅ DONE — Renderer implementation. Transitions: 10/10 complete (hard-cut,
   cross-dissolve, zoom, dip-black, dip-white, slide-push, whip-pan, wipe,
   glitch-rgb, light-leak — commits 675e322…76ccf16). Clip effects: 7/7
   complete (`e748345`, `8d98365`, `34910de`) — pixelate and speed-ramp were
   removed (pixelate unsupported in WebKit preview, speed-ramp excluded by
   design). Procedural overlays (4) and asset-backed overlays (6) moved to
   Deferred Polish Features.

SEQUENCING: Steps 1-2 fast/safe (UI+data) — done. Steps 3-4 structural backbone —
done. Steps 5-7 wire on top — done. Step 8 (renderer implementation) — done.
Effects Tab Rebuild plan is now complete.

---

## Rejected from Scope

- **Multi-window simultaneous projects** — 5–10 parallel webviews + renders would thrash the machine. Use tabs in one window or a render queue instead. Revisit only if single-window UX proves insufficient.

---

## SaaS Readiness Tasks

> Items required before public launch or multi-user distribution. Not scheduled — tracked here so they aren't forgotten.

- **Backend proxy for API keys** — Pexels/Pixabay/Coverr keys currently in JS bundle (VITE_ prefix). Required before public launch.
- **Auth layer** — No authentication; open access. Required for multi-user.
- **LGPL ffmpeg swap** — Current sidecar is GPL (libx264). Swap for LGPL-only build (OpenH264 or commercial x264 license) before public distribution.
- **4K export validation** — 1080p verified on macOS + Windows. 4K UI option exists but untested. Validate before advertising 4K support.
- **playbackSpeed UI re-expose** — Logic preserved in App.tsx; UI dropdown removed during 2026-06-17 BottomDrawer redesign. Re-expose as compact dropdown if user testing shows it's needed.
- **Restrict `fetch_url_bytes` with a domain allowlist (SSRF hardening)** — currently fetches any URL passed from the webview; acceptable for internal single-user use, required before public launch. `lib.rs`

---

## Key Invariants

Non-negotiables. Future work — especially the Architecture Shift active task — must not break these without a deliberate, documented decision.

- **(a) Sync timing is regression-locked.** `src/services/syncTiming.test.ts` (8 vitest tests, added in commit `05398f4` "lock sync timing pipeline with regression test") plus the `sync-known-good-2026-06-20` tag protect the sync/anchor timing pipeline. Tag message: *"Known-good single-click ms-correct sync. Baseline for per-slot re-sync work. Restore/bisect target if sync drifts."* Bisect or restore against this tag before reaching for a new fix if sync ever drifts again.
- **(b) Σ segment duration = voiceoverDuration.** Total segment duration must always equal the voiceover's duration. Transition overlaps cancel pairwise by construction (Path B cross-fade design, Decisions Log 2026-05-25), so this holds without special-casing `App.tsx`. This isn't theoretical: removing `splitAudio` in Heading Round 5 broke this invariant and cost 4 rounds of drift-bug fixes before headings were rebuilt as pure overlays.
- **(c) Headings are pure overlays** — no audio/duration splitting; insert/delete absorbs duration via a 50/50 split with neighbors (Heading Round 5). Fully array-only since Step 5 (5.1–5.4, done 2026-06-24, commits `b3a13e3`/`abcc75e`/`72c1fd3`/`6342c8d`/`2516a7c`): the segments array is the sole source of truth, never serialized to `sceneDetails` text — 5.3 stopped writing the `[HEADING:]` tag, 5.4 stopped `parseProjectData` reading it (recognize-and-skip: still a scene boundary, no segment). Dual storage is gone.
- **(d) Transcription cache validity is keyed by file identity, not asset id.** `getFileIdentity(file) = \`${file.name}|${file.size}|${file.lastModified}\`` (`src/services/syncEngine.ts:216`), cached as `Project.lastTranscribedFileIdentity` (`src/types.ts:215`). Necessary because every file-stage event mints a fresh `Asset` id even when the user re-picks the identical file — id/reference equality can't catch a re-stage, but name+size+lastModified can.
- **(e) `anchorSource` provenance only ever moves one direction.** `'whisper'` = precise audio alignment; `'estimate'` = character-weight approximation that Whisper can still realign later. An anchor may be demoted `whisper → estimate` but is never promoted back, regardless of text changes (enforced by `syncTiming.test.ts`).
  - *Post-3c follow-up note — closed 2026-06-24 (post-3d-2):* `anchorSource` is confirmed effectively write-only — no production code branches on `'whisper'` vs `'estimate'`. Still written by `parseProjectData`, `applyAnchorBasedTiming` PASS 1, `distributeSegmentTimes`, and `handleInsertHeading` (PASS 2, the other writer, was deleted in 3d-2). Now documented directly in the `anchorSource` doc-comment in `src/types.ts`; no further cleanup planned.

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision |
|---|---|
| 2026-06-28 | Windows dev environment: vcvars64.bat must be sourced before every cargo invocation on this machine (MSVC toolchain at custom D:\VSBuildTools2026b path, not on bare PATH). Permanent fix: .cargo/config.toml sets the linker path; dev.bat at project root sources vcvars64.bat then runs npm run tauri:dev — double-click to launch. Vite watcher configured to ignore src-tauri/target/** (EBUSY race condition on Windows). git identity set repo-scoped only on the Windows machine. |
| 2026-05-16 | **Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages for frontend. Free tier, edge CDN, unlimited bandwidth. Render backend deferred to Phase 3. |
| 2026-05-16 | **Target users:** YouTube creators. Initial private use across 5–10 channels owned by user's team. |
| 2026-05-16 | **Export approach:** ffmpeg.wasm in browser for Phase 3. Slower than native (3-5×) but $0 infra, works offline, no server. Pipeline code will port to native ffmpeg in Phase 6 with minimal changes. |
| 2026-05-16 | **Long-term distribution:** Desktop app via Tauri (Phase 6). Web app remains the development target through Phases 3-5; desktop wrap converts the same codebase. Native ffmpeg replaces ffmpeg.wasm for full-speed renders. |
| 2026-05-16 | **Branch strategy:** `main` is the stable branch. Feature work goes on short-lived branches, merged via PR. |
| 2026-05-16 | **Output format:** MP4 required for YouTube upload. Current WebM output is unacceptable for production — this is a Phase 3 blocker. |
| 2026-05-17 | **ffmpeg.wasm encode speed:** ~25s wall-clock per 1s of 1080p output (≈1.35s per frame at 30fps). Acceptable for Phase 3 validation; production-grade speed requires Phase 6 native ffmpeg via Tauri. |
| 2026-05-17 | **(Historical — wasm path removed in Phase 6.4) Safari export verified:** `crossOriginIsolated=true`, `SharedArrayBuffer` available, COOP/COEP headers correct, export completes, MP4 plays in VLC with H.264 + AAC. No code changes required for Safari support. |
| 2026-05-17 | **Global transition fallback:** `segmentEncoder.ts` now falls back to `project.globalTransition` when a segment's own `transition` field is NONE. Per-segment overrides take precedence. "Override all per-segment transitions" button in Settings still materializes the global value onto segments for per-segment overrides. UX revisit deferred to Phase 5. |
| 2026-05-21 | **Item 3 approach (preview transitions):** Pre-roll snapshot blend (option b). When playhead enters transition window, snapshot outgoing + incoming first frame to offscreen canvases, blend over transition duration via applyTransitionBlend. Universal coverage across image/video, single seek cost lands during pre-roll (before transition visually starts). Rejected option (a) image-only canvas overlay (asset-type branching complexity) and option (c) skip-and-document (would leave preview-vs-export gap user said to close). |
| 2026-05-21 | **NEON_FLICKER glow:** Implemented as ctx.shadowBlur + shadowColor pass on top of keyframe alpha pulse. Documented fallback path if visual quality regresses on dark backgrounds. |
| 2026-05-21 | **Overlay drag clamp policy:** Hard-clamp drag to [halfW/2, 100-halfW/2] (percent). Off-canvas positioning explicitly rejected — overlay drag is positioning, not animation authoring; off-screen reveal effects belong to AnimationType, not overlay position. |
| 2026-05-25 | **Path B over Path A:** The export pipeline now renders true cross-fades (both segments advance during the fade window) rather than holding the incoming segment static. Mechanism: outgoing segment encodes `trailingExtension` seconds past its boundary; incoming segment skips its first `transitionDuration` seconds via `startTimeOffset`. Overlap contributions cancel pairwise on the timeline, so `Σ duration = voiceoverDuration` invariant is preserved without changing `App.tsx`. Commit `261936f`. |
| 2026-05-26 | **Tauri v2 desktop wrap:** Chose Tauri (not Electron) for desktop packaging — smaller bundle, native WebKit, Rust backend. `tauri-plugin-shell` v2.3.5 provides the sidecar API. |
| 2026-05-26 | **Sidecar name resolution:** `sidecar("ffmpeg")` must use the bare name (no `binaries/` prefix). `tauri-build` copies `src-tauri/binaries/ffmpeg-<triple>` → `target/debug/ffmpeg` (strips both triple AND path prefix via `file_name()`). Runtime `relative_command_path()` constructs `{exe_dir}/ffmpeg` — exact match. Using `sidecar("binaries/ffmpeg")` resolves to `{exe_dir}/binaries/ffmpeg` which doesn't exist. |
| 2026-05-27 | **Static evermeet.cx ffmpeg build over Homebrew:** Homebrew binary (385 kB) was dynamically linked to `/usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/…/lib/` — not portable to machines without Homebrew. evermeet.cx 8.1.1 static build (76 MB) links only `/System/Library/` and `/usr/lib/` (verified via `otool -L`). Binary is gitignored; `src-tauri/binaries/README.md` documents re-provisioning. |
| 2026-05-27 | **Base64 IPC for frame writes:** Encoding `Uint8Array` as base64 before IPC and decoding on the Rust side eliminates the JSON-array-of-numbers serialization bottleneck. Speedup: 551s → 120s for a 4-segment project (4.6×). Further optimizations (Tauri Channel API binary IPC) deferred to Phase 7 if needed. |
| 2026-05-27 | **GPL sidecar for internal distribution:** evermeet.cx build compiled with `--enable-gpl` (includes libx264). GPL is acceptable for internal distribution (closed, no redistribution). Before public SaaS launch: swap for LGPL-only build (OpenH264 or commercial x264 license). Tracked as SaaS readiness item in `src-tauri/binaries/README.md`. |
| 2026-05-27 | **Branch strategy update:** Continuing short-lived feature branches, but merging directly to `main` with `git merge --no-ff` rather than via PR (single-developer workflow). |
| 2026-06-26 | **Draggable headings (task 6):** heading rows drag to any position via Pointer Events + setPointerCapture (no new dependency). Duration give-back/steal factored into shared syncEngine helpers (stealDurationFromNeighbors / giveDurationToNeighbors). Post-drag recompute uses anchor-free recomputeStartTimes, not applyAnchorBasedTiming. Stale-anchor behavior on pre-existing projects (locked neighbor edge case) is consistent with clean-slate philosophy — fresh sync resolves it. |
| 2026-06-26 | **Review Mapping popup (task 7):** new ReviewMappingModal at z-[150] with per-segment thumbnail, horizontal asset bar, stock search trigger (reuses existing StockSearchModal at z-[200] after bump), time range display. Mounted in App.tsx sibling to StockSearchModal. StockSearchModal z-index bumped from z-[100] to z-[200] to clear the new popup. *(The initial ship also had a mute toggle; it was removed in the `947082c` card-layout redesign and is not present in the current modal.)* |
| 2026-06-26 | **Review Mapping popup — post-ship polish (this session):** refinement of the already-delisted task 7 feature, not a new backlog item. Scene overlay x/y position wiring, lower-third default y=78, preview+export (`55aacc1`). Swatch/toggle/stock-split polish + overlay bg-color editor (`88169fd`). Overlay caption font-size wiring, bubble auto-width, bg-None option, removed auto-quotes (`603a268`). Square toggle, scene row reorder, scene X/Y sliders (`5bb778e`). Scene overlay + heading text edge-to-edge X/Y positioning + width fix in PreviewStage (`df52dc1`). Scene row consolidation — italic moved into formatting row, color+XY rows merged into one, shadow swatch removed, ban toggle relocated next to bg swatch, square toggle thumb sizing fixed (`1447813`). Review Mapping control converted from icon to a centered text button in the Segments tab header (`67c4547`). |
| 2026-06-27 | **Billing block resolved + CI made manual-only.** The push-blocking billing issue is fixed — `origin/main` now tracks local HEAD again. To prevent recurring metered usage, the build workflow was switched to manual-only (`workflow_dispatch`, commit `e725a46`); CI no longer runs on push. Live thumbnail 3b (`23c8227`) is the first feature pushed under the restored flow. |
| 2026-06-27 | **Shared SegmentControls + drawer/preview/timeline sync (commit `4887d33`).** Extracted the Review Mapping card's controls into a shared `SegmentControls` component reused by both the modal and the bottom drawer (modal unchanged — pure move; drawer is controls-only, no thumbnail). Bottom drawer recentered to a viewport-anchored 50vw block (motion-owned `x: '-50%'`), independent of side-panel state. Mute toggle relocated to the drawer header (scene-only); body mute row removed so scene/heading drawers match height. Left-panel segment click now seeks the time-driven preview to the segment and auto-scrolls the timeline to bring it into view. Closes backlog item 2 (bottom drawer redesign). |
| 2026-06-27 | **Effects Tab Rebuild Steps 5–7 + drawer effect-pills (commits `dd903b2`, `d0d8ca2`, `d750ce3`, `4b13cb0`).** Apply-to-selected/all and randomize now write real per-segment effect fields; combined-look presets (transition + animation + overlay slugs + 2 durations) persist globally via a new `src/services/lookPresetService.ts` (dedicated localStorage store, 20-cap, kept separate from the legacy single-category `presetService.ts`). Mid-session fix: preset ids are now preserved end-to-end through the service round-trip (the service no longer re-mints its own id), so the active "Restored" highlight survives a save. Bottom drawer header also gained a read-only effect-pills row. Step 8 (renderer implementation) is now the only remaining step in the Effects Tab Rebuild plan. All four commits are local-only — not yet pushed to `origin/main` (still at `1e249df`). |
| 2026-06-29 | **Effects Step 8 — transition renderer (Batch A + B):** All 10 transitions implemented in `applyTransitionBlend` (frameRenderer.ts) via pure canvas compositing — no getImageData/pixel readback anywhere. glitch-rgb uses lazy module-level scratch canvases + screen blend (cheap fake, visually indistinguishable at transition speeds). light-leak uses radial gradient bloom + screen blend, opacity shaped by alpha*(1-alpha)*4. Transition timing is Path B (100/0 split — entire window on A's trailing extension in export, last D seconds of A in preview) — documented as deferred known issue, not a regression. |
| 2026-06-30 | UI state persistence: kinetix:ui:v1 localStorage key stores activeLeftTab, leftPanelCollapsed, rightPanelCollapsed, previewHeight, currentTime, selectedSegmentId, timelineScrollLeft. handleSwitchProject preserveUiState flag distinguishes reload (preserve) from dashboard switch (reset). Timeline scroll listener lives in Timeline.tsx because timeline-scroll-area does not exist in DOM when App.tsx mounts. Restore deferred 300ms via setTimeout to let layout settle after double-mount caused by unbatched async hydration state updates. |
| 2026-06-30 | Caption max-width = 70% of render width (was 768px @1080p ≈40%). Applied identically in PreviewStage (CSS `maxWidth: '70%'`, resolves against inset-0 stage box, no JS) and frameRenderer (`w * 0.7`). Font-size/padding/radius remain height-scaled via refScale. Long captions now wrap later than before; preview/export parity preserved. |
| 2026-06-30 | UI-state persistence consolidated into `src/services/uiStateStore.ts` — single source for `kinetix:ui:v1` read/merge/write. Closes D6 and the structural risk of independent RMW writers (future async storage backend would otherwise reintroduce a real clobber). No behavior change. |
| 2026-06-30 | D10 fixed via pre-seek + requestVideoFrameCallback reveal-gating in PreviewStage dual-video slots (was: canplay-gated, which fires before paint). Canvas-hold kept as fallback. Preview-only; export untouched. |
| 2026-07-01 | D12 root cause was a native ghost click racing ahead of React state, not a derived-state timing bug — a browser `click` synthesized right after `mouseup` can hit-test onto a completely different element than the one `mousedown` targeted if the pointer drifted during the gesture (exactly what a left-edge timeline resize does, since that handle's DOM position never tracks the cursor). Three earlier fix attempts targeting `currentSegment`/`useTransitionPreview` staleness were real but not the dominant cause, because native DOM event dispatch isn't gated by any React state/effect timing at all. **Reusable pattern:** when a drag-release intermittently triggers an unrelated click-handler side effect, suspect a native ghost-click before assuming a React state race — fix by arming a one-time, capture-phase `window` `click` listener in the drag's mouseup handler (only when the drag actually moved the pointer) that swallows the very next click before any bubble-phase React handler sees it. Commit `be45b07`. |

## Open Questions

- [ ] Multi-user support — team accounts in v1, or stay single-user through Phase 5?
- [x] Asset storage for persistence — **Resolved (Phase 2):** IndexedDB is sufficient for single-user browser-local persistence. R2/S3 will be revisited when multi-user/cloud-sync arrives (likely Phase 5 or later).
- [x] Dangling segment references on asset delete — **Resolved (Phase 4, Step 3):** cleaned up at delete time via `c7515e5`.
- [x] Bundle splitting — **Resolved (Phase 4, Step 5):** jszip, StockSearchModal, SyncReviewModal are now lazy-loaded. Main bundle: 542 kB → 433 kB.
- [x] Stock API key handling — kept client-side for internal use; backend proxy deferred (tracked in Long-running Deferred Items as "Backend proxy for API keys — required for public launch").
- [x] **Phase 3 end-to-end export verified — 2026-05-17.** Multi-segment + voiceover + FADE transition + main Export button + VLC playback confirmed H.264/AAC. Verified before `phase-3-export` merged to `main`.

## Ignored Low Risk Bugs

Low/no-risk — intentionally not scheduled. Revisit only if a user reports impact.

- **D7 — Transition timing is 100/0, not true 50/50:** the entire blend window sits on one side of the cut (Path B design, preserves Σ-duration invariant) rather than the industry-standard centered split; true 50/50 requires clip handles or breaking invariant (b). `segmentEncoder.ts`, `exportPipeline.ts`
- **D8 — glitch-rgb faint color cast tail:** at alpha→1 the red/blue tint passes don't fully cancel, leaving a cosmetic fringe at the end of the transition; harmless at typical transition speeds. `frameRenderer.ts`
- **D9 — Caption-switch is instant during dissolve:** DOM-text captions can't be pixel-blended — the incoming caption appears immediately rather than fading in; inherent to the DOM-text rendering approach. `PreviewStage.tsx`
- **D11 — Preview letterboxing in normal view:** the preview stage shows letterbox bars in the non-fullscreen layout; under-documented placeholder behavior, not a regression. `PreviewStage.tsx`
- **D13 — Export cancel doesn't kill the in-flight ffmpeg subprocess:** the generation counter and session teardown fire immediately, but the running `ffmpeg_exec` sidecar continues to completion against the torn-down temp dir; the resulting error is swallowed. `useExport.ts`, `ffmpeg.rs`
- **D14 — Timeline ruler overflows track by a few px:** `Math.ceil(totalDuration) + 1` ticks each `pixelsPerSecond` wide exceed the segment content width; cosmetic, auto-scroll clamps correctly. `Timeline.tsx`
